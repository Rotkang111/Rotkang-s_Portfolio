                <h2>CODE PLATEAU EXPERIENCE</h2>
                <p>My Code Plateau experience so far can be best wrapped around one word "A BLESSING"; thus far, Code
                    Plateau has spurred my inner potentials positively in line with my passion in the field of Science
                    and
                    Technology which has beyond reasonable doubts proven over time to be the best medium in proffering
                    solutions globally.<br>

                <p>My second greatest Encounter is having to meet amazing, talented and brilliant tutors not excluding
                    the
                    highly motivational and impact driven individuals i am privileged to have shared, learnt
                    consistently
                    from and importantly have as colleagues and how that, to a small degree i have also had the rear
                    opportunity to render some help to a few in one way or the other.<br>

                <P>Code Plateau to me i must say is a "Dream come true" and that is because, right from
                    inception it has
                    kept me increasing on the learning pedestal which also focuses on moulding me to becoming a
                    solution
                    and
                    impact making advocate to the world; that i do not take for granted.<br>
                <p>Code Plateau has opened me up to new frontiers, and great opportunities by way of connections
                    to new
                    clients already and a strong platform to learn and unlearn, build, increase value and
                    capacity to
                    myself
                    in line with the 22nd century trend of operations generally. Hence, must say, "THE FUTURE IS
                    NOW"
                    indeed!<br>
